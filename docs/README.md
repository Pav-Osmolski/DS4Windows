## Contribute and maintain

- [Contributing](../contributing.md): reporting bugs, proposing changes and documentation rules.
- [Development](development.md): build, tests, packaging and code layout.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md): priorities and proposals, rather than a completed-task list.
- [Release process](release-process.md): numeric versions, draft builds and Latest publication.
- [Installer](../installer/README.md) and [installer validation](INSTALLER_VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md).
- [Translations](dev/translations.md) and [profile schema reference](dev/profile-schema-reference.md).
- [Technical reference](reference.md): runtime contracts and diagnostic tools.
- [Validation archive](validation/README.md): dated tests and investigations.

Release history belongs in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). Keep one canonical
page per topic, and link directly to it. A dated investigation describes its
recorded source and hardware; it does not establish the status of a newer build.
